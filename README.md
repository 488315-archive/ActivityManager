# ActivityManager
The Activity class is a crucial component of an Android app. An activity provides the window in which the app draws its UI. Most apps contain multiple screens, which means they comprise multiple activities. Typically, one activity in an app is specified as the main activity, which is the first screen to appear when the user launches the app. Those activities are shown in Launcher applications.

Activity Manager provides list of all activities of installed application and ability to run them.

Features:
* Start any exported activity
